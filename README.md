If u want to become the best traveler choose Zen Move
Zen Move is a mobile application that is designed to solve the experience of traveling.
The idea has come from our own experiences when we visited foreign cities where we didn't know what to do? what should we visit?  what should we move with? where to stay and even where to eat.
So we thought of making an all-in-one application with all 4 traveling needs
- Public transport / parking with your own car
- Accommodation - 
- Identification of tourist attractions
We even added a way to pay inside the app in case u want to buy a bus ticket online 
To create this application we used React Native for the front-end, NodeJS for creating the backend, python for identifying free parking spaces and MongoDB for storing the received data.
For now, the apllication can not find you the free parking spaces because we could not connect the python script for counting the free spaces to the NodeJS backend
